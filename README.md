2023.11.17:  
New generating and solving algorithms implemented.  
Now you can choose where the solving starts and ends (with a left and right click on the preferred grid).  
It's not needed to reset the maze anymore to solve it again.  

2023.11.15:  
Generating and solving algorithm chooser added to the gui. New generating algorithms implemented.  
Some refactoring.

2023.11.11:  
Maze generator and solver program made with c# and monogame.  
The program uses the Iterative implementation (with stack) of the Randomized depth-first search algorithm to ganerate, and uses the Tr√©maux's algorithm to solve the maze.
